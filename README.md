# PawesomeOS
A learning project for me, working on making a toy OS in Rust. I *try* to follow some UNIX design philsophy, but my goal is *not* to make a UNIX/POSIX compliant OS - not my goal not to, whatever direction it goes is where it goes.

# Resources
There's a few resources I lean on heavily throughout all my code, though I try and mention them specifically in each repository, there's two sources where a lot of code is "borrowed" from;
- [Phil Opp's "Writing an OS in Rust" blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
- [The OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/)
