## Haii 👋
Hai, welcome to the repository for PawsomeOS! A toy OS project I am working on primarily in Rust.

While I do try and follow UNIX/POSIX designs and philosophy (such as almost *everything* being a file), my goal isn't to be POSIX compliant, though that isn't something I'm against, my goal is more just to work on the system, and see how it develops from there.

## Resources I Rely On
There's a few resources I lean on heavily throughout all my code, though I try and mention them specifically in each repository, there's two sources where a lot of code is "borrowed" from;
- [Phil Opp's "Writing an OS in Rust" blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
- [The OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/)
